This project is to classify urban sound through their Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). The machine learning methods used are linear multi-class SVM and kernelled multi-class SVM. Algorithms are written by numpy instead of calling functions from sklearn directly so that we can understand the whole process better.
