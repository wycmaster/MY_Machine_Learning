This project is to classify urban sound through their Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).
The machine learning methods used are linear multi-class SVM and kernelled multi-class SVM.

Algorithms are written by numpy instead of calling functions from sklearn directly so that we can understand the whole process better.

My used urban sound dataset is URBANSOUND8K from the Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP) at NYU.(
